#### This repository includes various files that illustrate my learning progress, ranging from simple and rudimentary programming to more complex projects. Some filenames may be generic, reflecting the nature of the learning process. Please feel free to explore the contents of this repository. Notable programs are listed below:
1. üìÅ[CarInsurance](CarInsurance), this is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes a user‚Äôs input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
2. üìÅ[TwentyOne](TwentyOne), this is a console application that allows the user to play a game of twenty one. It allows the user to input their name, and the amount of money they have brought. They can make bets and input choices on their hands whether they stay or hit. This console app is linked to a database to save all exceptions that are thrown.
#### Feel free to explore the projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me. Thank you for visiting my repository.
