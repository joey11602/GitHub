# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
I created this folder to use while I go through The Software Developer Boot Camp HTML & CSS Course @ The Tech Academy. 
There are a lot of files on here that pertain to my class work. They are simple assignments to help me learn how to code. You are welcome to look through them. But by themselves, they do not make a lot of sense. I do, however, have some notable assignments that are not completely functional web sites, but they do have form and some function. They show my progression as a software programmer.

1. The Hunting Lodge Project - This web page is an example of a hunting lodge web site. It is styled in CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
   - [index.html](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/index.html)
   - [shared.css](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/css/shared.css)
   - [animations.css](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/css/animations.css)
2. Exercise Tuscaloosa Project - This web page is an example of a 5K run web site that you can sign up for and watch a video on training.
   - [one_page_website.html](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/One-Page-Website/one_page_website.html)
   - [one_page_website_2.css](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/css/one_page_website_2.css)
3. Crimson Tide 2023 Football Schedule Project - This was an assignment to put various elements throughout the web page. I used the Crimson Tides Football schedule as a theme. It has text overlaid on images and video. It has columns made from unordered lists, and text animation on the navbar and overlaid texts.
   - [1_through_10_challenge.html](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/1_through_10_challenge.html)
   - [1_through_10_challenge.css](Basic_HTML_and__CSS/css/1_through_10_challenge.css)
4. Academy Cinemas Project - This web page is an example for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including a navbar, jumbotron, a form, and cards.

5. My Portfolio Project - This is by far the most complicated web site to date in my training. It will be updated with javascript in the future so that it can be modified at the server level so viewing it on a mobile device will be possible. It has been published on the web @ [josephkay.org](https://josephkay.org/). It is linked to my GitHub repository, "HTML-and-CSS-Projects" to display my work. It has a great deal more animation than anything I have done so far, and it has been personalized with an about me section. It has a navbar that moves across the screen and a title page that flows down from the top to settle in place over a video background. It also has a functioning contact form. So, feel free to reach out and offer me a job. You will not be disappointed!
