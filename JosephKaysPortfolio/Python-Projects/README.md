# Python-Projects
#### I created this folder to use while I go through The Software Develorer Boot Camp Python Course @ The Tech Academy. I have learned a lot so far like, all the different type of variables and how to use them. I have learned about lists, dictionaries, tupples, and arrays. I have learned about functions, methods, conditional statements, and loops. I have learned how to import modules through the CMD. I have learned about proper syntax and indention, program flow, passing variables from code blocks back and forth. I have learned how to set up and work in virtual environments. Learned about dunder methods and error handling. I learned how to interact with the OS with Python. I have learned how to work with databases through python code. I have learned all about object-oriented programming with Python. I learned about inheritance and polymorphism creating classes. I have learned how to create GUIs in Tkinter. I have learned about encapsulation and how to make code reusable and seperated into modules. I have learned how to work with sqlite3 in Python. I learned a great deal working with Django which really started putting everything together for me. I had heard about working in environments where most of the code is written already but Django was next level to me! It opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities! And finally I was introduced to Docker, though it was just an introduction, it certainly is a game changer!<br><br>There are a lot of files on here. Most of which are simple and ruamentary programming to teach me concepts. As you will see, some didn't even get original names. Feel free to look through them. I do have some notable programs in her that are listed below.


1. My first functional program.
-[Nice_or_Mean_tutorial.py](Nice_or_Mean_tutorial.py)
2.   This program transfers file from one directory to another if they have been created in the last 24 hours
   -[file_transfer.py](JosephKaysPortfolio/Python-Projects/file_transfer.py)
3. A simple web page generator
   -[web_page_generator.py](JosephKaysPortfolio/Python-Projects/web_page_generator.py)
4. This last program was a banking app that runs in a Django server. You can view the files but without setting
   of Django on your system it will not function. All the files are in the directory below.
