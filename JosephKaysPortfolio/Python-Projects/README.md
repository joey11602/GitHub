# Python-Projects
#### I created this repository while progressing through The Software Developer Boot Camp Python Course at The Tech Academy. During the course, I gained comprehensive knowledge, including various concepts such as:<br>
- Understanding different variable types and their usage.
- Implementing lists, dictionaries, tuples, and arrays effectively.
- Exploring functions, methods, conditional statements, and loops.
- Learning the process of importing modules.
- Using proper syntax, indentation, and program flow.
- Utilizing techniques for passing variables between code blocks.
- Working proficiently in virtual environments.
- Using dunder methods and error handling.
- Interacting with the operating system through Python.
- Handling databases and object-oriented programming with Python.
- Utilizing inheritance and polymorphism by creating classes.
- Developing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using Tkinter.
- Understanding encapsulation and ensuring reusable, modular code.
- Working with sqlite3 in Python.
#### Moreover, my exposure to Django truly consolidated my understanding, offering a comprehensive view of integrating various concepts. It was a significant step that exposed me to the vast possibilities of pre-built environments. Lastly, my brief introduction to Docker was a game-changing experience, opening up new possibilities in my development journey.<br>
#### This repository includes various files that illustrate my learning progress, ranging from simple and rudimentary programming to more complex projects. Some filenames may be generic, reflecting the nature of the learning process. Please feel free to explore the contents of this repository. Notable programs are listed below:
1. My first functional program using Python is very simple but it is a milestone for me. Here is it: [Nice_or_Mean_tutorial.py](Nice_or_Mean_tutorial.py)
2. This program transfers file from a directory to another of your choosing if they have been created in the last 24 hours: [file_transfer.py](file_transfer.py)
3. A simple web page generator: [web_page_generator.py](web_page_generator.py)
4. This last program was a banking app that runs in a Django server. You can view the files, but without setting
   of Django on your system, it will not function. All the files are in this directory: üìÅ[Checkbook_Project](Checkbook_Project)
#### Feel free to explore the projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me. Thank you for visiting my repository.
