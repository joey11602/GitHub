# Python-Projects
#### I created this folder to use while I go through The Software Develorer Boot Camp Python Course @ The Tech Academy.
#### I am about half way through this Python course now. 
#### I have learned a lot so far like, all the different type of variables and how to use them. I have learned about
#### lists, dictionaries, tupples, and arrays. I have learned about functions, methods, conditional statements, and loops.
#### I have learned how to import modules through the CMD. I have learned about proper syntax and indention, program flow,
#### passing variables from code blocks back and forth. Today I worked with our first complex program, a word game. It is pretty
#### simple but it help to teach me how to pass variables in and out of code blocks to other code blocks. I customized it with
#### some sound effects.
